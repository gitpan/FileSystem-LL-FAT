FileSystem-LL-FAT version 0.01
==============================

With recent prolifiration of standalone devices which understand only FAT,
and (unreliably) write to it, it is crucial to have flexibility to
have cheap low-level backups of the most fragile part of FAT: the
service area.

The target of this module is to have machinery in place to extract
information from broken FAT volume.  All one needs is a backup of
the bootsector, of file allocation tables, and listing of files
with starting clusters.
